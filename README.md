#  React-test App

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install` to install dependancies
### `npm start` to serve on port 3000

Open `http://localhost:3000/` on your favorite web browser to see the output.

## Improvement points

- Bind auto scroll on left click on FilmsPortaits in order to scroll automatically to a decent position.
- Make a button instead of the OnChange on the search bar to make less requests and therefore don't flood the browser with get requests.
- The view can always be improved.
- Hide the api key somehow.
- Hide fields with no output from que query (eg: Release date)


## Output on my browser:
